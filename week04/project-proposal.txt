1. Project Topic
------------------------

Website Project Topic: Latacunga Taxi Quotes: Trip Quotation Tool for a Local Taxi Cooperative.

-----------------------
2. Site Content
-----------------------

The website will consist of three pages built using native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on dynamic data handling:

Request Page (index.html): A user interface form for inputting Origin and Destination.

Quotation Page (cotizacion.html): Displays the calculated fare and travel time. This page will implement the core logic, using fetch() with a try...catch block to retrieve distance data from an external API. It will also feature a "Featured Fleet" section.

Company Page (empresa.html): Static corporate and service information.

The "Featured Fleet" section will be dynamically generated by loading a local JSON file and utilizing Array Methods (like .filter() or .map()) and Template Literals to render at least 15 items of content efficiently.

3. Reason for Choosing This Subject
------------------------------------

I chose this project because it addresses a real, immediate necessity within my city, Latacunga. Currently, there is a lack of transparency and a standard tool for customers to view estimated ride costs before ordering a service. This application aims to solve this problem by providing a simple, quick, and reliable quotation tool, making the local taxi cooperative's service more professional and competitive.

Furthermore, this project directly requires the implementation of all core competencies: consuming an external API using fetch() and try...catch for robust error handling, managing local data via JSON, and advanced DOM manipulation achieved through Array Methods and Template Literals to build a dynamic, real-world utility application.
